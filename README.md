                                       A Novel Approach on Modularized MLP-Mixer for Automated Histopathological Classification of Lung and Colon Cancers
This Project is based on Modularized MLP-Mixer that will classify the types of lung and colon cancer.It is trained on Histopathalogical images of tissue samples. This dataset consists of 5 Classes:
	Lung benign tissue
	Lung adenocarcinoma
	Lung squamous cell carcinomaColon adenocarcinoma
   Colon benign tissue
We have provided the link to our lung and colon cancer dataset here 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biplobdey/lung-and-colon-cancer
you can download the dataset from here and thus can perform augmentation as per your requirements.We have done augumentation on dataset by doing Horizantal and Vertical Flips,Some Angular Rotations.Our Final dataset consists of 35,000 images.
